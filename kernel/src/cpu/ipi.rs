/// This module implements inter-processor interrupt support, including the
/// ability to send and receive messages across CPUs.  Two types of IPI
/// messages are supported: multicast and unicast.  Sending a multicast IPI
/// will cause a message to be delivered to one or more CPUs as a shared
/// reference.  Sending a unicast IPI will cause a message to be delivered to a
/// single target as a mutable reference, permitting the receiving processor to
/// modify the contents of the message such that the sender of the message can
/// observe the response.  In all cases, the request to send a message will not
/// complete until all receiving CPUs have completed handling the request.
///
/// Multicast IPIs can be used to target a single CPU, an arbitrary set of
/// CPUs, or all CPUs (optionally including or excluding the sending CPU).
///
/// Sending an IPI requires the ability to raise TPR to TPR_SYNCH.  If the
/// current TPR is already above TPR_SYNCH, then the IPI request will panic.
///
/// Two traits support the delivery of IPI messages: `IpiMessage` and
/// `IpiMessageMut`.  Each of these traits requires an implementation of an
/// `invoke` method which will be called on every receiving CPU to handle
/// the message.  The `invoke` method will be called on every receving CPU,
/// including on the sending CPU if it is a selected target.  The `invoke`
/// method is always called with TPR equal to TPR_IPI.  TPR-sensitive locks
/// may not be used unless they are designed to be held at TPR_IPI.  TPR_IPI
/// is higher than TPR_SYNCH, so it is not possible to send an IPI from an
/// IPI handler.
///
/// All IPI messages that can be sent as a multicast IPI must implement `Sync`
/// in addition to implementing `IpiMessage` because these messages will be
/// processed simultaneously by multiple CPUs, requiring cross-thread
/// synchronization.  `Sync` is not required for unicast messages, since those
/// messages can only be processed by a single processor at a time.

/// The `IpiTarget` enum describes the set of CPUs that should receive a
/// multicast IPI.  There are four variants.
/// * `Single` indicates a single CPU, described by CPU index (*not* APIC ID).
/// * `Multiple` contains a `CpuSet`, which is a bitmap of multiple CPUs
///   selected by CPU index.
/// * `AllButSelf` indicates all CPUs other than the sending processor.
/// * `All` indicates all CPUs.
